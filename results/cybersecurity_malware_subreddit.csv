Here are some of the stories we'll be covering:

**VMware bugs abused to deliver Mirai malware, exploit Log4Shell**  
Researchers say a GitHub proof-of-concept exploitation of recently announced VMware bugs is being abused by hackers in the wild who are focused on using them to deliver Mirai denial-of-service malware and exploit the Log4Shell vulnerability. “Researchers analyzed the attacks and payloads detected by Barracuda systems between April to May and found a steady stream of attempts to exploit two recently uncovered VMware vulnerabilities: CVE-2022-22954 and CVE-2022-22960”says a report from Barracuda. CISA has released an emergency bulletin that requires emergency action from Federal Civilian Executive Branch agencies to either immediately implement the updates or remove the affected software from their network until the updates can be applied.

**93% of orgs have suffered a data-related business disruption**  
The 2022 State of Ransomware and Disaster Preparedness survey from the International Data Corporation (IDC), found that, last year, 60% medium and large organizations in North America and Western Europe suffered irrecoverable data loss, up from 43% the previous year. Seventy-nine percent of organizations indicated they activated a disaster recovery response over the last twelve months, with nearly two thirds (61%) attributing these incidents to ransomware or other malware. Respondents reported an average of 19.3 attacks (all types) and 2.3 ransomware attacks in the past year, with 93% of organizations suffering a data-related business disruption over the same period.

**Phishing attacks surge in Q1**  
Security researchers from Kroll found that phishing emails as an initial attack vector increased 54% on the year in Q1. This rise caused incidents tied to email compromises to surpass ransomware for the first time in a year. Kroll pins this uptick on a rise in activity from both Emotet and IceID malware. Once attackers used phishing for this initial beachhead, attack methods varied widely, from dropping ransomware and malware, to in some cases attempting extortion just based off stolen data without any backing encryption attempt. Generally attackers did not only attempt phishing emails as an initial attack vector, but also attempted to exploit vulnerabilities like ProxyLogon and Log4Shell.

**iPhones are vulnerable to attack even when turned off**  
A team of researchers from Germany’s Technical University of Darmstadt discovered that iPhone features including Bluetooth, Near Field Communication (NFC) and Ultra-wideband (UWB) technologies, which have access to sensitive info via iPhone’s Secure Element (SE), stay on via low power mode (LPM), even when modern iPhones are powered down. Researchers assert this could potentially allow an attacker to load malware to the device and access secure data such as a user’s credit card info, banking details or even digital car keys. While Apple has not responded to the findings, researchers say one potential solution would be to add a hardware-based switch which disconnects the battery while an iPhone is powered down.

**North Korean devs pose as US freelancers to aid DRPK govt hackers**  
The U.S. government is warning that the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) is dispatching its IT workers to get freelance jobs at companies across the world to obtain privileged access that is sometimes used to facilitate cyber intrusions. To get into the desired position, the North Korea's IT workers often pretend to be teleworkers located in the U.S. or other non-sanctioned country. To obfuscate their true identity and pass as an individual from a non-sanctioned country, North Korean IT workers often change their names, use virtual private network (VPN) connections, or use IP addresses from other regions. The US Treasury has published an advisory that helps organizations identify these workers. A link to the advisory is included in the shownotes to this episode at [CISOSeries.com](http://cisoseries.com/): [https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/126/20220516\_dprk\_it\_worker\_advisory.pdf](https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/126/20220516_dprk_it_worker_advisory.pdf)

**Costa Rican ransomware rhetoric somehow gets uglier**  
The Conti ransomware group posted messages on their leak site notifying the Costa Rican government it raised its ransom demands to $20 million worth of cryptocurrency, and threatening to “overthrow” the government of newly elected President Rodrigo Chaves. Conti already leaked 97% of 670GB of data stolen from government agencies, leading the government to declare a state of emergency. Conti’s ransomware attacks have had significant impacts on digital services from the government, leading the Finance Ministry to tell citizens to calculate taxes by hand and pay them at local banks, rather than through an online portal.

**Trying to fix open source supply chain security**  
After meeting with officials in the Biden administration, the Linux Foundation and Open Source Security Foundation announced plans to invest over $150 million over the next two years to make the open source software supply chain more secure. This comes as part of an overall 10-point plan to boost open source security. A group of tech companies including Amazon, Ericsson, Google, Intel, Microsoft and VMware already pledged $30 million in initial funding. As part of this, Google Cloud said it would launch an  Open Source Maintenance Crew, a dedicated team of engineers who will work directly with upstream open source maintainers.

**D-Wave deploys first US-based Advantage quantum system**  
Quantum computing outfit D-Wave Systems has announced availability of an Advantage quantum computer accessible via the cloud but physically located in the US. D-Wave reported that the newly deployed system is the first of its Advantage line of quantum computers available via its Leap quantum cloud service. The new system is based at the University of Southern California, as part of the USC-Lockheed Martin Quantum Computing Center hosted at USC’s Information Sciences Institute, a factor that may encourage US organizations interested in evaluating quantum computing that are likely to want the assurance of accessing facilities based in the same country.

Virtual machine that can protect itself from malware on the host?,Bawat,2022-05-18 19:15:14,"Let's say you had a data store, and you wanted to access the data store without risk of it becoming infected. But the challenge is, the data must be hosted on the same machine used to access it - so no hiding behind a different physical machine. Is it even possible for a virtual machine to protect itself from the host? Would setting read-only permissions make something like this work, or would malware be able to undo that too? Maybe some vm tech that runs the traditional host inside a virtual machine and uses the traditional vm as the host?

Here are some of the stories we'll be covering:

**NIST releases updated guidance for defending against supply-chain attacks**  
Titled the “Cybersecurity Supply Chain Risk Management Practices for Systems and Organizations,” the guidance from the National Institute of Standards and Technology details the risks at all levels of the organizations, it provides information about major security controls and practices that organizations should adopt to identify, assess, and respond to these threats. The document includes warnings such as the need for diligence towards devices that may have been designed in one country with its components manufactured across multiple countries worldwide, resulting in a dramatic enlargement of the surface of attacks for organizations.  
([Security Affairs](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/131066/laws-and-regulations/nist-supply-chain-guidance.html))

**US State Department offering $10 million reward for information about Conti members**  
In addition to this reward which is for any information that leads to the identification or location of people connected to the notorious Conti ransomware gang, an additional $5 million reward is also being offered for any information that leads to the arrest or conviction of a Conti member. In a statement on Friday, State Department spokesman Ned Price said the group has been behind hundreds of ransomware attacks over the last two years. Specifically, as of January 2022, there had been over 1,000 victims of attacks associated with Conti ransomware with victim payouts exceeding $150,000,000, making the Conti Ransomware variant the costliest strain of ransomware ever documented,” Price said.

**College closes permanently due to ransomware**  
Lincoln College informed the Illinois Department of Higher Education and Higher Learning Commission that it will close its doors as of May 13th. This is believed to be the first US college to shutter operations as a result of a ransomware attack. In December, the college was hit by a ransomware attack, “hindered access to all institutional data” and took down all systems around recruitment, retention, and fundraising. Lincoln College restored access in March 2022, but combined with falling enrollment due to the COVID-19 pandemic, could not find a viable way forward with operations.

**Microsoft launches service to fill the cyber skills gap**  
Microsoft announced three new managed security services under its new Microsoft Security Experts suite. The company says these are designed for organizations of any size impacted by the ongoing cybersecurity skills shortage. Microsoft Defender Experts for XDR will enter into preview this fall, effectively offering a managed version of Microsoft 365 Defender. Security Services for Enterprise officially launched in full, offering security consulting services from the company. And a preview of Microsoft Defender Experts for Hunting launched, which  looks for threats across a customer’s endpoints and cloud applications.  
([Protocol](https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/microsoft-security-service-managed-xdr))

**Security assessments significantly impacting vendors**  
A new study by Whistic highlights the business impacts of performing vendor security assessments. The report found that, with the rise in data breaches caused by third-party vendor vulnerabilities, the number of vendors assessed annually increased by 20% from the prior year. And while vendors invest significant time and resources into undergoing SOC2 and ISO27001 assessments, 77% of companies indicate it is Very Likely or Likely that they will still ask for additional security documentation. Unfortunately, these assessments are not standardized with 82% of companies using fully or partially customized security questionnaires to evaluate their vendors. On average vendors are spending over 80 hours per month responding to security assessments with 79% percent of them saying these assessments add a week to the sales cycle, or more if their customers need clarification on any of their responses.  
([Whistic](https://www.whistic.com/resources?hsLang=en))

**Malware goes regional as attackers change tactics**  
The new Cloud and Threat Report from Netskope reveals that most malware attacks now originate from the same region as the victim, representing a marked tactical shift by threat actors. Netskope attributes this to attackers attempting to avoid geofencing filters and other prevention measures. Additional report findings saw Trojans accounting for 77 percent of all malware downloads, with attackers using social-engineering techniques to get malicious payloads past their victims. Nearly half (47%) of malware downloads originate from cloud apps. On a positive note, attacks involving malicious Microsoft Office documents are on the decline.  
([The Register](https://www.theregister.com/2022/05/10/malware_attacks_regional/))

**A look at ransomware trends of 2022**  
SecureList put out a list of ransomware trends to be on the lookout for in the rest of the year. One that we’ve seen on this show before is threat actors trying to develop cross-platform ransomware to be as adaptive as possible. We’ve seen this with ransomware being written in Rust and Golang to make it easier to port to other platforms, as well as harder to analyze. Another trend is the industrialization of ransomware, with affiliate models for ransomware increasingly the norm. As we’ve seen in the Conti leaks, in many ways, these ransomware operations run on typical software development practices. The Conti leaks are also illustrative of the third trend, ransomware gangs taking sides in geopolitical conflicts. We saw the pro-Russian stance of Conti leading directly to leaked data by pro-Ukranian members.

**Google will use mobile devices to thwart phishing attacks**  
Google this week announced anti-phishing efforts that will make it possible to use Android and iOS devices in the same way as physical security keys such as Google’s Titan Security Key. Google is bundling the Titan capability into mobile devices, where Android and iOS devices use Bluetooth to verify they are in physical proximity to the device the user is trying to log into. Google is also expanding the types of Google Prompt challenges that users may experience if their login attempts look potentially fraudulent, including challenging users to connect their mobile devices to the same Wi-Fi network as the device they are attempting to log into.

**Texas man gets 5 years for stealing 38,000 PayPal account credentials**  
Marcos Ponce, 37, of Austin, also was ordered to pay $1.4 million in restitution, according to a Justice Department press release. Court documents in the case show that from at least November 2015 until November 2018, Ponce and his co-conspirators established buyer accounts on an illegal online marketplace which sold stolen payment account credentials along with complementary personal identification information. Prosecutors contend that Ponce and his co-conspirators developed social engineering techniques so they could dupe third parties into accepting money transfers from the compromised PayPal accounts before transferring the money into accounts they controlled.

Installing and using Cuckoo Sandbox,ugonikon,2022-05-12 17:53:11,"Hello all,

&#x200B;

I would like to install the Cuckoo Sandbox, but I have a few questions in advance regarding the required hardware and virtualization components:

&#x200B;

I have seen and read over and over again that Ubuntu is used as the host system. However, I myself only have a Windows host and would therefore have to install an Ubuntu VM and then Cuckoo in it. But Cuckoo installs probably another Windows 7 VM; that means I would have a VM in a VM. Would this work? How would it look like with the hardware requirements? After all, the Windows 7 VM would use the resources of the Ubuntu machine, which are also only provided virtually.

I don't want to install Cuckoo on my Windows host, because I don't want to work with malware directly on my normal machine.

Now, I'm going to be moving into a SOC, and I'm not sure what to expect. So for anyone who is or has worked in a SOC, is there any advice you can give about what to learn moving forward? What concepts should I familiarize myself with?  And most importantly, are there any unspoken SOC rules I should know about?

I should also state that I'm self taught, I have no certs or degrees. I was looking into getting my Net+, Sec+ and so on. At this point, is it still worth it to get these certs, or should I move onto something else? Thank you all for your advice :)

In need of ideas for SIMPLE(!) Malware,Josef-Knecht,2022-05-01 20:05:18,"Hi everybody,  


I am a teacher at a university of applied sciences and my plan is that the students will have to write by them self a small piece of malware next semester. The tasks should be simple and in most cases they will, i guess, use Python, Java or C# (they are free to choose).   
My ideas at the moment go in the direction of keylogger, stealing or changing the clipboard, screen recording. Do any of you have other nice ideas for a small tool? No problem if it's a tool that already exists professionally. It is important to me that the students learn the basic ideas. That the programs will probably be roasted by any EDR solution is clear, that's not the point.

Questions about starting a career in Cybersecurity:,blizzard_is_lanky,2022-05-01 09:09:20,"Hello, I'm a high school student and I've done quite a decent amount of career research on Cybersecurity. I've seen plenty of articles and people online saying that after college, it's very unlikely to land a Cybersecurity job because most of these jobs require prior experience in the field. Here are my questions:

1. What jobs should I look for after I graduate college in order to begin my career path in Cybersecurity? (I will be majoring in Computer Science)
2. How hard is it to actually get an internship for a Cybersecurity job as a college student? I heard that it's an option, but apparently it's very hard to do.
3. If I get a job as some other CS subfield (lets say a software developer or something with networking), work there for a couple of years, and study for certs and hack the box in my free time, would that count for experience that employers are looking for? Or are they specifically looking for Cybersecurity-related experience?

Here are some of the stories we'll be covering:

**Hackers find 122 vulnerabilities, 27 deemed critical, during first round of DHS bug bounty program**  
These vulnerabilities were found by more than 450 security researchers who were working through the Department of Homeland Security’s “Hack the DHS” bug bounty program, which started in December 2021. The researchers, who were vetted by the agency before participating, were eligible to receive between $500 and $5,000 for verified vulnerabilities, depending on the severity. The DHS has not disclosed the vulnerabilities that were found, nor did it share any information about fixes for the bugs. Under original plans for the DHS program, the agency would verify the flaws within 48 hours of being notified, and fix them within 15 days — or, for more complex bugs, develop a plan to address them.

**AWS’s Log4j patches blew holes in its own security**  
Amazon Web Services has updated its Log4j security patches after it was discovered the original fixes made customer deployments vulnerable to container escape and privilege escalation. The vulnerabilities introduced by Amazon’s Log4j hotpatch – CVE-2021-3100, CVE-2021-3101, CVE-2022-0070, CVE-2022-0071 – are all high-severity bugs rated 8.8 out of 10 on the CVSS. “We recommend that customers who run Java applications in containers, and use either the hotpatch or Hotdog, update to the latest versions of the software immediately,” the cloud giant said in a security bulletin on Tuesday.  
([The Register](https://www.theregister.com/2022/04/20/aws_log4j_patches/))

**Mandiant finds record zero-days in 2021**  
According to the security firm’s annual report, disclosed zero-day vulnerabilities exploded in 2021, more than doubling the previous 2019 record with 80. Most of the zero-days tracked by Mandiant were exploited by APT groups. Since it began tracking in 2012, Mandiant reports that China exploited more zero-days than any other nation. The growth in zero-days mirrors a report from Google’s Project Zero, which also saw a record number of zero-days in 2021. However Project Zero believed this was due to better industry disclosure rather than just an increase in zero-days discovered.

**Elon Musk’s Twitter takeover could be bad for security and privacy**  
After this week’s announcement that Twitter has accepted Elon Musk’s $44 billion purchase offer, cybersecurity experts fear that Musk’s open source vision for the platform may make it more susceptible to malicious actors. Experts are expressing concerns about open source vulns such as Log4Shell and also the potential for “gaming” the algorithm to treat people differently based on their personal characteristics. Additional concerns are being raised by Privacy advocates regarding Musk potentially implementing real-name policies, overriding anonymity and pseudonymity which protects the identities of those whose opinions do not align with those in power.

**Stormous Ransomware targets Coca Cola**  
On Tuesday, Coca Cola admitted that some of its systems were potentially hit by a ransomware variant but says it is still investigating the incident. Meanwhile, Stormous Ransomware group released a statement that it has stolen about 161GB of data from Coca-Cola and is intending to sell the data if its ransom demands were ignored. Coke announced last month that it is withdrawing business from the Russian Federation because of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine which some are speculating could have precipitated the attack by the Stormous gang who have been trying to make money through supporting Russia’s political agenda.

**State Department puts a price on NotPetya’s head**  
The State Department announced its offering a $10 million reward for information leading to the six Russian intelligence actors responsible for the now infamous malware. This reward comes as part of the Rewards for Justice program. While it’s explicitly focused on the NotPetya actors, the reward can also apply to  “any person who, while acting at the direction or under the control of a foreign government, participates in malicious cyber activities against U.S. critical infrastructure.” Since launching in 1984, the Rewards for Justice program has paid out over $200 million in rewards, and currently also has bounties out for the REvil and DarkSide ransomware groups.

**Two-thirds of organizations hit with ransomware**  
According to Sophos’ State of Ransomware 2022 report, 66% of organizations surveyed were hit with a ransomware attack last year, up from just 37% in 2020. This comes as the ransom’s paid by organizations increased nearly five-fold on the year to an average of $812,360. 11% of organizations said they paid ransoms over $1 million, up from 4% in 2020. Organizations paying less than $10,000 dropped to 21%. Overall 46% of organizations that had data encrypted paid ransoms, including 26% of organizations that were able to restore data from backups. 83% of mid-size organizations had cyber insurance policies, with 98% of incidents paying out for costs incurred, including 40% covering ransoms themselves.

**French fiber optic cable attacks accentuate critical infrastructure vulnerabiliti**es  
A day after what French telecom companies are calling a large-scale coordinated attack which destroyed a large number of fiber optic cables powering the French internet, authorities there are investigating the attacks as a criminal act. The Wednesday incident disrupted Internet service throughout France, and those responsible seem to have known how to do as much damage as possible. “The cables were cut on both sides to complicate the repairs,” an ‘operator’ told newspaper Le Parisien. “The urgency is to re-solder everything, this represents tens of thousands of small, fiber-optic cables.”

Submitting hacked applications to AV vendors,ScratchedTrack,2022-04-26 06:40:20,"I've been tasked to figure out a way to submit hacked (aka pirated) copies of my company's application to AV companies.  While we know that hacked copies of our app have contained malware in the past, I can't say that's always the case.  I just don't have the skills to do a full forensic analysis.  What I can say is that the hacks that are used do break the digital signature and we do not believe they should be trusted.

Is there an aggregation service that would allow me to submit hacked samples, and then forward this along to the AV companies?  Or do I have to reach out to each AV vendor individually?

Would these samples be of interest to AV companies if submitted?  Would they flag them based on a broken signature only?

Choose your battles | Mitigation vs Remediation | A Gecko vs a Komodo Dragon,rvilladiego,2022-04-26 04:57:24,"We recently had an experience with an incident at an organization that points to an error I think a lot of SOC teams can fall victim to. I decided to bring this topic to this community to spread out this lesson on a particular operational exercise that we perform every day: Mitigation vs Remediation. Here is a summary of the events:

To sanitize the information, I’ll be referring to a hypothetical timeline of how the events occurred.

**Day 1**

On a particular Monday, automated contacts with an adversary spreading malware were detected. The impacted assets triggered contacts almost exactly ***every 2 hours during a 24-hour period***. The incident was reported to the cybersecurity team of the company in question. This [image](https://imgur.com/gKrTOAc) shows the contact pattern.

The cybersecurity team ***diligently*** reviewed the behavior stating ‘thank you, but the firewall is blocking these contacts so we must be safe.”

**Day 5**

Five days have passed and the behavior if anything has become more pervasive across all days of the week. Now contacts to ***the adversarial infrastructure are identified almost every hour.*** Details are shown in this [image](https://imgur.com/JHfONUt).

The cybersecurity team now reaches out saying: “I think this is a false positive. I have nothing to do the firewall is blocking these contacts we are safe.” To which we replied, “Well, there is a lot you can do. Why don’t you review the endpoints that are triggering this behavior? It’s good that the firewalls are blocking these contacts but don’t you think that the endpoints should not attempt these contacts in the first place?”.

**Day 7**

A formal escalation of the problem was reported to the management team of the impacted organization as there was evidence of lateral movent detected. A simplified version of the lateral movement detected is presented in the following table and a real sanitized behavior in the following [image.](https://imgur.com/M1wz0qm)

&#x200B;

|Device|Day 1|Day 3|Day 5 |Day 7|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Asset 1|X||||
|Asset 2||X|||
|Asset 3|||x||
|Asset n||||x|

The cybersecurity team reached out—***And I have to say the tone was not the best—***“We have been forced to investigate this incident that the firewall has been blocking from day 1.”

**Day 9**

A full assessment by the cybersecurity team identified that the lateral movement reached out to the couple's active directories. Some accounts were created and they had the chance to reverse the situation but were dealing with an imminent ransomware incident that ended up only affecting some remote endpoints. ***I have to say the tone was better in this conversation.*** 

**The Lesson**

A couple of learnings that I want to share with the community from this situation:

* Mitigation doesn’t equal remediation. The fact that a security control is blocking a bad connection is good but it’s better to understand why the connection was triggered in the first place and try to get to the root cause to remediate it.
* We can choose our fights. I like to compare it to a ***gecko (Day 1)*** that evolves into a ***komodo dragon by Day 7 to 9***. It’s easier to win the battle against the gecko, and while it might not be ‘sexy’, that’s the battle that I prefer to have every day.",https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/ubvb34/choose_your_battles_mitigation_vs_remediation_a/

\- It shows up on compromised WordPress sites  
\- It appears to latch onto toast popups of Outlook messages  
\-  No clicking on web browser assets is required for this stuff to get on  your system and operate, only loading the pages in question  
\- No files representing IOCs could be found when scouring the drive  
\- Mcafee ENS, Microsoft Defender, & Malware Bytes did not pick it up anywhere on full scans

\- It hops onto any Windows 10 system with both the latest Firefox and Chrome browsers  
\- No out of the ordinary process names show up in task manager  
\-  sfc /scannow checks out system files integrity as ""OK"", not sure how  much this would detect DLL or system .exe hijacking anyway

The popups that persist on the toast notifications in the OS look like this:

New to Malware Analysis - sources for school project?,Interesting-Trash774,2022-04-11 23:53:25,">tldr;  
 My question is what are the recommended sources where I could find malwares + analysis or description that would suit my project?  
Is there any advice you could provide me with?

Hello,

As part my thesis I would like to focus on analysing malware, preferably some interesting rats and rootkits, really interested in how they hide themselves in the system and how they get to cause further damage.   
For this I understand I need some samples and before that I need an access to some kind of database or place where these malwares have some broader description attached to them so that I could browse around and find ones that would interest me.  
I am guessing the best way for this would be to find something of database/ web where people have analysed malware and have provided some documentation that tells me what does the malware do + sample.   
I would like to do hybrid analysis. I dont think I should assume myself to be able to analyse something someone hasnt analysed before, when I am completely new to this and it would also limit my ability to choose what to analyse and write about since I would have to go throught it first, however I should have an year + more for this project, so even thought I wont be able to fully dedicate myself to it, I will have time to do some studies.  


My question is what are the recommended sources where I could find malwares + analysis or description that would suit my project?  
Is there any advice you could provide me with?

No truly effective anti-phishing tech - really?!,go_deeprr,2022-04-09 03:28:56,"u/Hot_Discipline_5705 posted an excellent, comprehensive summary of phishing problems and solutions:  [People Still Aren't Patched or Protected](https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/tz8q44/people_still_arent_patched_or_protected/)

Doesn't this state of affairs raise a fundamental question?

**Are there no truly effective anti-phishing technologies?**

So the two biggest causes of phishing infections are:

1. Opening an infected attachment.
2. Clicking on a bad link.

For crying out loud, can't all attachments be automatically screened for malware? And if users need attachments from third parties beyond easily screenable MS Office files and PDFs, how about requiring that (a) those files automatically go through an internal check by a third person or AI, or (b) the user must reply to the sender with directions for the sender to upload the files to the company portal?

Sure, you're going to object that users will scream bloody murder about the inconvenience. For a small percentage of operations, you may have a valid point. But for the general run of users and attachments, don't we have defenses that prevent users from opening them and instantly compromising the network?

As for bad links, again, do users have to have instant, unreviewed access via links in their emails? I understand that we don't have perfect systems for filtering out bad URLs and that cybercriminals are constantly innovating. Yet is it absolutely essential for the general user population to have instant access to every link they receive in their emails?

If a link is not for a domain that is safelisted by the organization, can't the user be expected to wait while the link goes through a delayed review process? Can't the user be notified later that the link is safe? Again, I understand that there may be some workers for which this would be impractical, but couldn't they be exceptions to a general approach to non-safelisted domains?

Note:  There are various other phishing dangers beyond attachments and bad links. But what about solving these two? Can't technology go a long way to closing these rampantly exploited holes?

We haven't solved the problem of negligent users killing networks. We haven't solved the problem of negligent drivers killing either. But first we added seatbelt requirements. Then crashworthy standards. Then airbags. Also night-driving restrictions for teens and tougher drunk-driver restrictions. Now lane-change warnings and automatic braking. Driving miles keep increasing and deaths per mile keep decreasing. How are we doing with our cyber safety innovations and related user inconveniences?",https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/tzbb2o/no_truly_effective_antiphishing_tech_really/
Top cybersecurity stories for the week of 04-04-22 to 04-08-22,CISO_Series_Producer,2022-04-08 22:05:07,"Below are the top headlines we’ve been reporting this whole week on Cyber Security Headlines.

If you’d like to hear and participate in a discussion about them, the CISO Series does a live 20-minute show every Friday at 12:30pm PT/3:30pm ET.

Here are some of the stories we'll be covering:

**National Security Agency employee indicted for ‘leaking top secret info’**  
The United States Department of Justice (DoJ) has accused an NSA employee of sharing top-secret national security information with an unnamed person who worked in the private sector. According to a DoJ announcement and the indictment, an NSA staffer named Mark Unkenholz “held a TOP SECRET/Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) clearance and had lawful access to classified information relating to the national defense.” The indictment alleges that on 13 occasions between 2018 and 2020, Unkenholz shared some of that information with a woman identified only as “RF” who was not entitled to see it. The indictment and announcement allege Unkenholz used his personal email address to send material to RF.

**Companies going to greater lengths to hire cybersecurity staff**  
According to an article in Dark Reading, employers are desperately seeking to fill cybersecurity positions. The number of available cybersecurity jobs coupled with accelerated attrition due to the Great Resignation has led to companies offering ridiculously high salaries, a bevy of benefits, and free training and certifications to woo candidates. Even so, the candidate pool is limited. Employers are exploring ways to help applicants fill in the gaps in their experience so that they can be hired. “The No. 1 thing anyone interested in cybersecurity careers should do is apply,” says Justine Fox, principal product manager, technical, at NuData Security, a Mastercard company. “There is no faster way to learn the role’s required skills than in the role. Whether you are self-taught or formally educated, I encourage folks to apply.” Mitch Ashley, principal at Techstrong Research, suggests cyber leaders must “widen the net” to bring in “talents beyond only traditional cybersecurity domains,” he adds, and managers “must think more like software leaders and less like network engineers.”

**Cadbury scam is anything but sweet**  
Users on Facebook and WhatsApp report a new scam attempting to lure users with a promise of a free easter basket of Cadbury Eggs. Cadbury confirmed its aware of the scam and is taking action to resolve the issue. Clicking on the link to claim your free basket takes you to a page where you’re asked to share personal information. It does not appear that the page installs any malware directly, but it’s probably not a good idea to share anything you don’t have to with people operating a scam.

**Russians increasing turning to Western news**  
Cloudflare published data showing that people inside Russia are increasingly circumventing domestic blocking to get news from Western sources. Russia has blocked direct access to Western media and social networks, but has not isolated the country from the global internet. In March the most downloaded mobile apps in Russia include VPN tools, the secure messaging app Telegram, and Cloudflare’s DNS resolver WARP. By looking at WARP data, Cloudflare saw a precipitous rise in Russia-based use, with most DNS lookups involving large French, British, and U.S.-based newspapers.

**MailChimp hit with breach**  
We reported yesterday on Trezor wallet owners receiving phishing emails. Now we know the actors obtain those emails. Over the weekend the email marketing firm disclosed that hackers gained access to internal customer support and management tools through social engineering, obtaining personal information that was subsequently used in phishing attacks. Overall 319 accounts were accessed with audience data exported. API keys were also obtained for an unknown number of users, which have since been disabled. Customers in the cryptocurrency and finance sectors were targeted.

**US disrupted Russian botnet**  
Attorney General Merrick Garland announced that government officials disrupted a botnet built by the Sandworm hacking group linked to Russia’s GRU intelligence agency. Sandworm had previously been blamed for attacks against Ukraine’s electric grid in 2015 and the NotPetya attacks in 2017. This botnet used “Cyclops Blink” code to target WatchGuard Technologies’ Firebox firewall hardware and was also able to infect some Asus network hardware. Garland said the government believed it was taken down before it could be weaponized to perform any malicious activity.

**Twitter shadowbans Russian government accounts**  
The social network announced that it will “drastically” reduce the chances of people seeing posts from accounts belonging to the Russian government as part of further measures to limit Russia’s ability to leverage the platform. This means these accounts won’t be suggested to follow or appear in Search or Explore pages. In an effort not to spread content that risks violating the Geneva Conventions, Twitter will also “require the removal of Tweets posted by government or state-affiliated media accounts” that contain media showing prisoners of war from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Twitter’s head of site integrity, Yeol Roth, said there are exceptions to this policy for media that is “compelling public interest or newsworthy POW content.” Twitter will also remove any content showing PoWs with “abusive intent” across all accounts.

**Amazon secures rockets for broadband project**  
Over the next five years, three new heavy-lift rockets will put thousands of satellites into low earth orbit as part of Amazon's Project Kuiper. The project aims to provide broadband connections using a constellation of 3,236 satellites. Rival Starlink is said to have more than 2,300 satellites in orbit already. The rockets will be made by Arianespace, Blue Origin - which was founded by Amazon owner Jeff Bezos - and United Launch Alliance. Amazon says Project Kuiper aims to provide high-speed, low-latency broadband to customers including households, businesses, government agencies, disaster relief operations, mobile operators, and other organizations ""working in places without reliable internet connectivity"". Like Elon Musk's Starlink, users will connect to the internet via a terminal that communicates with the satellites. Amazon says its experience in shipping and making products like Echo and Kindle will be useful in producing and distributing these.

I am from Europe and a lot of malware analyst jobs first and foremost require programming skills as the basic skill needed for the job instead of reverse engineering skills.

I watched some youtube videos and I did some port scanners and vulnerability scanners along with the videos but when I need to write code alone I feel that brain freeze which I really have no idea what to start with. 

But here is the deal and I am asking for your opinions.

A lot of malware analysts and even John Hammond said that you need to learn how to read code instead of writing code because you are not a developer. Of course, I think all of the malware has obfuscated code and you need to reverse engineer it, but how can you reverse engineer something that you don't exactly know how to read? How can you guess how to stop that malware if you don't know anything about the code .

My strategy now is to look and read a lot of written code and watch maybe how the first historic malware was written and then try to learn reverse engineering. 

What are your opinions on this?

Tools to monitor a private network?,roconf,2022-04-05 23:28:58,"Hello everyone,

I'm currently increasingly dealing with the topic of networks and the security of devices within my network. I'm aware that there are a lot of enterprise solutions for this topic but I would like to get some hands-on experience with my own network. Are there tools to monitor the traffic of your network for private users? The tools I found cost multiple hundred of dollars and I assume that I'm just looking for the wrong thing.

The idea: Let's say one of my devices got infected with some malware which now tries to ship some data from my device back to the creator.

Do I have the possibility to detect such a thing? My first thought was hosting my own DNS server. I would notice connections to strange domains. But it doesn't do me any good if the malware uses IP addresses. I know that in large companies whole teams are entrusted with the security of the network and also use tools that analyze the traffic. But I assume that this is primarily done by additional hardware solutions sitting in front of the router. Am I wrong about that? Also, is there anything worthwhile for home use?

I looked at Wireshark but that seems to be a bit too much to handle right now.

"‘Dangerous’ EU web authentication plan threatens to undercut browser-led certification system, detractors claim",GsuKristoh,2022-04-05 00:41:55,"An EU proposal to force browsers to accept web certificates created by the bloc risks “upsetting a carefully curated set of rules and technologies that undergird almost all privacy and security online”, according to a leading cybersecurity expert.

Joseph Lorenzo Hall, distinguished technologist at the Internet Society (EFF), is among 38 signatories to an [open letter](https://www.eff.org/document/eidas-letter-2022) addressed to the European Parliament that criticizes the plans.

Published on March 3, the missive urged EU lawmakers to reject a proposed amendment to the [eIDAS](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/eidas-regulation) – or electronic Identification, Authentication, and Trust Services – regulation, which was passed in 2014 to facilitate the emergence of a European internal market for trust services.

eIDAS mandated the creation of Qualified Website Authentication Certificates (QWACs), which essentially vouch for a website’s professed identity. As such, the scheme purports to protect users from malicious domains parading as legitimate platforms and therefore malware, surveillance, identity theft, and financial crime.

However, critics point out that QWACs attempt to solve a problem already addressed by an existing system – only less effectively. QWACs have so far failed to gain much traction in the web ecosystem “owing to flaws with its technical implementation model”, says the open letter.

Worse still, in compelling web browsers to recognize the authority of QWACs, a contentious proposal from the European Commission would circumvent tried-and-tested security protections offered by prevailing mechanisms.

At present, valid website certificates are issued by more than 100 [certificate authorities](https://www.digicert.com/blog/what-is-a-certificate-authority) (CAs), whose suitability for this critical gatekeeping role is vetted by leading browser makers.

Websites that pass muster use the TLS-encrypted HTTPS protocol, which protects communications with the site, and are flagged as secure by a padlock icon in the URL address bar.

Google (developer of Chrome), Mozilla (Firefox), Microsoft (Edge and IE), and Apple (Safari) all run ‘root programs’ that validate CAs’ compliance around issuance practices. CAs that fall below the required standards can be removed.

By contrast, QWACs are issued by ‘Trust Service Providers’ (TSPs) that are approved, not by browsers, but by the governments of EU member states.

This has prompted Firefox CTO Eric Rescorla to [warn](https://blog.mozilla.org/en/security/mozilla-eff-cybersecurity-experts-publish-letter-on-dangers-of-article-452-eidas-regulation/) that **the EU scheme may embolden repressive regimes that have already tried and failed to “ramp up their surveillance capacities by forcing browsers to automatically trust their CAs”.**

Remote code execution flaws in Spring and Spring Cloud frameworks put Java apps at risk  
This development has sparked fears that it could have a widespread impact across enterprise environments, since Spring is one of the most popular open-source frameworks for developing Java applications. The flaw, which has since been dubbed SpringShell or Spring4Shell, is tracked as CVE-2022-22965 and is rated critical. The Spring developers confirmed that its impact is remote code execution (RCE), which is the most severe impact a vulnerability could have. A Chinese developer released a proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit on GitHub and then removed it, prompting widespread speculation about the unpatched flaw, its causes and potential impact. There was also some early confusion between this vulnerability and a different one patched Tuesday in Spring Cloud, a microservices library that's different from the core Spring Framework. This will be a developing story.

‘Precursor malware’ infection may be a sign you’re about to get ransomware  
Lumu Technologies founder and CEO Ricardo Villadiego suggests that “precursor malware,” which is essentially reconnaissance malicious code, lays the groundwork for a full ransomware campaign to come. Companies that can find and remediate that precursor malware can ward off the ransomware attack, he says. He bases his statements on a study of more than 2,000 companies that Lumu monitors, in which every ransomware attack came with other malware preceding it and paving the way. Lumu collected information from such aspects as DNS queries, network flows, access logs, firewalls and proxies and correlates the data to identify whether any asset is trying to contact an adversarial infrastructure. “A better way to operate, he says, “is by assuming you’re compromised and let your network prove otherwise.”

Apple and Meta leak user data to hackers posing as police  
Bloomberg reports that the tech giants fell prey to a phishing operation that tricked employees into handing over customer data to cybercriminals posing as law enforcement. In 2021, the hackers sent fake “emergency data requests” to the companies demanding customer info including street addresses, IP addresses, and phone numbers. The messages included forged signatures of police officers. Sources say the perpetrators are believed to be affiliated with “Recursion Team,” a now-defunct hacking group that is said to have spawned members of the infamous Lapsus$ ransomware gang. Allison Nixon, chief research officer at cyber firm Unit 221B, commented, “In every instance where these companies messed up, at the core of it there was a person trying to do the right thing.”

Hackers abusing the power of subpoena  
In the US, when a government or law enforcement agency wants to obtain information on a social media account or IP address tied to a cell phone, they submit a court-ordered warrant or subpoena, with most major platforms having pipelines to process the request. In cases of imminent harm, an authority can submit an Emergency Data Request, which does not require court-approved documents. Brian Krebs reports that there is no way for platforms to determine if these requests are legitimate, with hackers using illicit access to police email systems to request information on people. These tactics were offered for sale by the hacking group Recursion Team on forums back in 2021. Some of Recursion’s members are believed to be active in Lapsus$. Bloomberg’s source say Apple, Meta, and possibly Snap provided customer data to hackers posing as law enforcement.

Lapsus$ shows that not all MFA is created equal  
One of the table stakes recommendations for shoring up security usually involves implementing multifactor authentication. But recent cyber attacks by both Lapsus$ and APTs like Nobelium show that older forms of MFA offer substantially weaker security protections. Both used a technique known as MFA prompt bombing to get around these protections, effectively spamming an end user’s legitimate device with push notification authentication prompts until the user accepted the authentication and gave the attackers access.

One in four employees who fell victim to cyberattacks lost their jobs  
According to new data from Tessian, over the past 12 months, one in four employees lost their job after making a mistake that compromised their company’s security. Tessian’s report also highlighted that of those who made security errors at work, 26% fell for a phishing email in the last 12 months and 40% of employees sent an email to the wrong person, with almost 29% saying their business lost a client or customer because of the error. Half of those employees said they sent emails to the wrong person due to pressure to send the email quickly while over 40% of the phishing attack victims cited distraction and fatigue as the root cause. The report also highlighted a 5% uptick (to 21%) in employees who indicated they did not report security incidents versus the prior year’s report.

Log4Shell exploited to infect VMware Horizon servers  
On Tuesday, researchers from Sophos revealed that the now infamous 10.0 severity remote code execution (RCE) vuln, Log4Shell, is being actively exploited to deliver malware to unpatched VMware Horizon servers. The researchers say the attackers are deploying remote monitoring packages, Atera agent or Splashtop Streamer, as well as an offensive security implant called Silver, to serve as backdoors. The attackers have also been observed deploying four different Monero crypto miners (z0Miner, JavaX miner, Jin, and Mimu) to exploited machines. Finally, the researchers uncovered evidence of reverse shell deployment designed to collect device and backup information. Although Log4Shell patches were released back in December 2021, sadly many internet-facing servers have not yet been updated.

Chance of obtaining an entry level job?,Whyachi-LYL,2022-04-01 17:26:13," I know this question has been asked a million times but after reading through a majority of those post I am a little worried. Currently I am set to graduate in fall with my B.S. in Cybersecurity as well as currently working on getting my Sec+ cert. I have 0 experience in the IT field though I have applied to some internships (have not heard back from them yet). Throughout my time in college the skills I have learned are:

C++ Programming  
Java Programming  
Linux cmd  
Windows cmd  
Powershell  
Ghidra basics  
Wireshark  
Security Onion  
Kibana  
SQL Management Studio  
RStudio  
Metasploit  
Metasploitable 3

As well as I have general knowledge of things like the 7 OSI layers, SYN-ACK, malware, viruses, attacks (SQL injection, zero-day, etc).

With metasploitable 3 I know its intentionally vulnerable but it has allowed me to learn about reconnaissance, execution, and persistence and what to look for in the Security Onion, Wireshark, and Kibana. It has also allowed me to have a lot more time with the Linux terminal and familiarize myself with commands other then basic usage like nmap, netscan, grep, cat, etc . We have also done a CTF.

I know experience is king and I'm certainly not looking at getting a 6 figure job upon graduation but would I be able to land a tier 1 SOC Analyst job or a Jr. Cyber Analyst job if I don't get an internship? If I need to start at the help desk then so be it I'm really just looking to get into anything IT related.

On top of getting my Sec+ cert and looking for an internship is there anything else I can be doing? I have read to do TryHackMe as well as participate in CTFs. Perhaps another cert I could be looking at? Thank you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/ttml9b/chance_of_obtaining_an_entry_level_job/
"How different is Cloud security ? | Is this the new ""field of battle"" ? |",Agent_B99,2022-04-01 11:53:46,"Hello, I work as a lvl 1 SOC Analyst and of course I want to learn and take a higher role in the future, but I find myself a bit lost in the cloud.  
I work with Azure and Google cloud mostly and I got three certs : AZ-900,SC-900 and the SOC Associate one SC-200.

If you are familiar with the cloud you will see that there are a lot of  SIEM/SOAR/XDR systems and antiviruses and firewalls but the focus is on identities and weather a user is who he says he is .

And on top of that a VM that is infected can be erased and nothing bad happens execept if the malware excapes the VM . Or can the hacker/malware reach another VM ? 

Is forensics on VM the same as on premise computers ?

 I know that ""hacking shows that anything is possible"" and that is the reason I need a little bit of guidance in this field . I think it can be a bit confusing to get your first job directly on cloud but then again it is a good job .

Military Cybersec/IR to private sector,stooxnoot,2022-03-30 06:52:20,"Hey all! I know military to private sector is hit on a lot, but I didn’t see many experiences from cybersecurity MOSs. 

I was in for 4 years, and switched my job to Cybersecurity, for an additional 4 years. 

I currently work on an Incident Response team (Cyber Protection Team). We do a variety of things such as hunting for malware/maliciousness on customer networks, responding to incidents, forensic analysis of machines after-the-fact, Malware Analysis, and more, to include building the response/hunt toolkit. 

Now, I know IR is usually filled with already experienced folk in the private sector. And it’s a bit odd for me to go from no IT experience to jumping straight into IR/Cyber Sec. 

But I’m curious if in y’all’s opinions, if that would be overlooked if I’m transitioning out of the military with 4 years of experience with IR/SIEMS/Kit building/Malware Analysis. I’d really like to laterally move into a position doing the same stuff, without stepping down the IT ladder first. 

I’m constantly anxious about needing to study more and more to fill experience gaps due to feeling like I have to be really really competitive when I exit the military with only 4 years experience. I’m in college (UMGC) for software dev and security to familiarize myself with reading code and writing automation/scripting, but I won’t have it finished by my exit mark. 

Anyone have thoughts or advice to share?",https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/trs3bx/military_cybersecir_to_private_sector/
How do you value a masters degree in cyber security?,casperwouden,2022-03-28 21:03:39,"Hi guys, I'm currently doing my masters in cyber security and was wondering how you guys would rate the value of the diploma? 

The master is given by a top notch research group in cyber sec (they are for example the publishers behind RIDL and spectre-v2).

We take dedicated courses in software security, network security, malware analyses, hardware security and some other courses which are security related. All from a scientific pov as well as getting our hands dirty (for example the practical part of software security was set up as 30 CTF kinda challenges covering all the way up to ROP-chains and things a like).

I've read that experience is very valuable in this field. but when I'm done I do not really have experience except this and a BSc in computer science. Would you think I'd start as a junior in a comp sec position? Does this diploma actually give me a bit more than the regular computer science master degree when trying to find a job? 

I've done a bit of vacancy hunting but most of the positions I found did not really ask for a scientific background. They looked more aimed towards the practical side of things and were also willing to invite people from a lower level of education.

I've read many times in here that certificats don't really add a lot compared to experience. That made me a bit anxious so that's why I'm reaching out.

Thanks for taking your time to read this!

I love the study BTW. It's great!!",https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/tq8u8u/how_do_you_value_a_masters_degree_in_cyber/

How to investigate a suspicious file?,Webly99,2022-03-24 14:37:42,"Hey folks,
I would like to know how you deal with an incident when your anti-virus (For example, mcafee) find a file as a malware.
Only how to check if the file is valid, or actually suspicious.


The only thing I know to do is:
1. Check the hash in websites like virus total.
2. Check if the file name appear on the internet.
3. Check with the server owner if he knows the file and if he triggered somehow the file.

(The anti-virus only tell me if the file is blocked).

How Hackers do research about their targeted system/architecture,wannacry011,2022-03-23 05:41:57,"Recently I read few articles about Ploutus.D malware.

SO MY QUESTION IS: How hackers know how to make malware that will exploit ATM and hack it so it start spitting money. Or any other type of system. Any other type of architecture.  
Do they need to know source code of that ATM Vendor? If so, how they find it? Do they connect laptop to ATM so they ""download"" it to their laptop so then they can learn about ATM?   
I guess that if they write malware in some programming language and write some command in that malware file, if ATM doesn't recognize or can't do that, mission failed.   


I gave ATM as an example. If you have some better example so you can explain me, go on.

Next Steps for a SOC Analyst,areciboalien,2022-03-22 12:22:31,"Hello all, looking to see what tips and advice others may have for someone who is currently a Level 1 SOC analyst. I've been working in a 24 by 7 SOC for about 7 months now and I'm about to transfer to another SOC role. While I'm not feeling the burnout quite yet (having a tolerance for boring, repetitive tasks helps), I know working in a SOC role is not my end game. I think at most I would like to work my way up to a Level 2 and then look at transistioning careers.

My career interests run the gamut of penetration testing, malware analysis, and forensics. I'm thinking that eventually I would like to work in a role that is more intense and along the lines of actual incident response rather than being the guy who escalates the fun stuff to somebody else. I also have an interest in Linux systems and database security, but not sure if those things would be an easy transistion from what I'm doing now. I have my Sec+ under my belt and will hopefully have some other tool-specific certs soon.

What career paths have other SOC analysts taken? What certs should I be looking at getting? I would love the input of others in this community with more experience than I have now. Thanks.",https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/tjuqnk/next_steps_for_a_soc_analyst/
